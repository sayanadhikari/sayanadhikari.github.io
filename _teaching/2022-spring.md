The course covers basic principles on plasmas, waves in plasma, stability analysis of the equilibrium solutions of the equations. Examples are taken from the phenomena in the Earth’s ionosphere and magnetosphere.

Learning outcome
=======
After completing the course you will:

understand and use the basic mathematical formalism needed for describing the dynamics of continuous media.
have a very good knowledge of mathematical models for plasma and will be able to distinguish the dynamics of plasmas and neutral fluid media.
have a very good knowledge of formulating and modifying the basic dynamic fluid equations to account for the dynamics of plasma media at different levels: from MHD to kinetic scales.
be able to describe the propagation of waves in plasmas, and derive the dispersion relation for these waves.
have basic knowledge on plasma instabilities and turbulence.
be able to make a simplified model for the Earth´s magnetosphere, and obtain analytical expressions for some characteristic quantities.
