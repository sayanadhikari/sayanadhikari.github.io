## Short Bio

Dr. Sayan Adhikari is currently a Research Scientist at the [Institute for Energy Technology (IFE)](https://ife.no/en/), Norway, where he focuses on Computational Physics, Numerical Modeling, and Code Development. He received his Ph.D. in Plasma Physics from [Gauhati University](http://gauhati.ac.in/), India, in 2019, where he developed numerical codes to analyze [magnetized plasma sheaths](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Magnetized-Plasma-Sheath).

Following his Ph.D., Dr. Adhikari served as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Centre of Plasma Physics](http://www.cppipr.res.in/), a division of the [Institute for Plasma Research](http://www.ipr.res.in/), where he conducted numerical investigations into the [communication blackout of space vehicle re-entry](https://www.spaceacademy.net.au/spacelink/blackout.htm).

In 2020, he joined the [Plasma and Space Physics](https://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/research/groups/plasma/index.html) group at the [Department of Physics](https://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/), [University of Oslo](https://www.uio.no/english/), Norway, as a Postdoctoral Fellow. At Oslo, he was part of the [4DSpace strategic research initiative](https://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/research/projects/4dspace/), focusing on the study of plasma interactions with spacecraft and Langmuir probes in the polar ionosphere.

Dr. Adhikari joined IFE in September 2022, where his current work includes advancing energy technology and developing digital twins for the material processing industry, leveraging his extensive background in plasma physics and computational science.
