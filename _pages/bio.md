## Short Bio

Dr. Sayan Adhikari received his Ph.D. in Plasma Physics from [Gauhati University](http://gauhati.ac.in/), India in 2019. He spent almost five years developing numerical codes to analyze [magnetized plasma sheath](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Magnetized-Plasma-Sheath). Then he spent two years as a Postdoctoral Fellow at [Centre of Plasma Physics](http://www.cppipr.res.in/), a centre of [Institute for Plasma Research](http://www.ipr.res.in/) working on numerical investigation and analysis of sheath in [communication blackout of space vehicle re-entry](https://www.spaceacademy.net.au/spacelink/blackout.htm). In 2020, he joined [Plasma and space physics](https://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/research/groups/plasma/index.html) group as a Postdoctoral Fellow in [Department of Physics](https://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/), [University of Oslo](https://www.uio.no/english/), Norway. At [University of Oslo](https://www.uio.no/english/), he is a part of the [4DSpace strategic research initiative](https://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/research/projects/4dspace/), where the group is invested in studying plasma interaction with spacecraft bodies and Langmuir probes in the polar ionosphere.
