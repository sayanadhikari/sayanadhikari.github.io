## Research Interests

### Primary Research
* Developing digital twins for material processing industries.
* Plasma interaction with spacecraft bodies and Langmuir probes in the polar ionosphere.
* Modeling of rover bodies in harsh lunar environments.
* Ion dynamics and sheath structure in Inertial Electrostatic Confinement Fusion (IECF) machines.
* Magnetized plasma sheaths.
* Dust charging in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas.


### Past Projects
* **Emirates Lunar Mission (ELM)**: 
  * The Emirates Lunar Mission involves the deployment of the Rashid Rover on the Moon, where it will explore the lunar surface and study lunar dust dynamics.
