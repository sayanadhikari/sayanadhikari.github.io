## Primary Research
* Plasma interaction with spacecraft bodies and Langmuir probes in the polar ionosphere.
* Ion dynamics and sheath structure in Inertial Electrostatic Confinement Fusion machines.
* Magnetized Plasma Sheaths.  
* Dust charging in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas.
## Numerical Tools/Codes
- Kinetic
  - [XOOPIC (X11-based Object Oriented Particle in Cell code), Michigan State University, USA](https://ptsg.egr.msu.edu/).
  - [PINC (Particle-In-Cell code)](https://github.com/pincproject/PINC), University of Oslo, Norway.
  - [PICSP (Particle-in-Cell Simulation of Plasma)](https://github.com/sayanadhikari/picsp), Centre of Plasma Physics, Institute for Plasma Research, India.
  - [Gkeyll Vlasov-Maxwell code](https://gkeyll.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL), USA.
- Fluid
  - [IDFM - (Ion Dynamics using Fluid Modeling)](https://github.com/sayanadhikari/ion-dynamics-mag), Centre of Plasma Physics, Institute for Plasma Research, India.

Apart from above, I am also a Python enthusiast and I try to use this language to develop visualization toolkits and basic machine learning models.
