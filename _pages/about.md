<!-- I am a Computational Physicist with an interest in problems across multidisciplinary topics in the fields of plasma physics, space physics, computer science, and mathematics.

I work as a Researcher in Space Plasma at the [Department of Physics](https://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/), [University of Oslo](https://www.uio.no/english/), Norway.

My primary interests are modeling and simulation of plasma processes in experimental and natural plasma systems. Along with developing and optimizing computer codes, I participate in laboratory experiments and work alongside teams for space and planetary missions.

Here at [University of Oslo](https://www.uio.no/english/), I am a part of the [4DSpace strategic research initiative](https://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/research/projects/4dspace/), where we study plasma interaction with spacecraft bodies and Langmuir probes in the polar ionosphere.

Apart from research, I am also passionate about promoting science in rural areas, especially among underprivileged students, through the non-profit organization [GMS Foundation](https://foundation.gmsciencein.com/). I like writing [popular science articles](https://gmsciencein.com/user/sayanadhikari207/?profiletab=posts). 

I often spend time building computers and electronic gadgets using Raspberry Pi or Audrino.

## About Me

I am a **Research Scientist** at the [Institute for Energy Technology (IFE)](https://ife.no/en/) in Norway, specializing in **Computational Physics**. My work primarily focuses on **Numerical Modeling** and **Code Development** for a range of applications. With a PhD in Plasma Physics and over a decade of experience, my expertise spans **Mathematical Modeling**, **Data Visualization**, and **Large-scale Data Processing**.

## My Research Interests

My current research interests include:

- **Digital Twins**: Developing data infrastructure for creating digital twins, incorporating tools like Node-RED, InfluxDB, and Grafana.
- **Plasma Physics**: Modeling and simulation of plasma processes in both experimental and natural systems.
- **Multi-Physics Modelling**: Applying the Finite Element Method and Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations in material processing industries.

In addition to my computational work, I have a passion for advancing **Energy Technology** and contributing to a more **Sustainable Future**. I am always open to collaboration and discussions on the latest innovations in physics and energy technology.

## Professional Experience
