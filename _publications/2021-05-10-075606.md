excerpt: 'A low-pressure magnetized plasma is studied to find the dependency of sheath properties on ion-neutral collisions in presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field. A self-consistent one-dimensional two-fluid hydrodynamic model is considered, and the system of equations is solved numerically. The study reveals that the width of the plasma sheath expands and space charge increases with collisions. The ion-neutral collisions and the inhomogeneous magnetic field restrict the ions to move towards the surface. The movement of the ions towards the wall can be controlled by choosing a suitable configuration of the magnetic field and ion-neutral collision frequency. A comparison between two different magnetic field configurations has been presented alongside to differentiate the commonly found scenarios in the field. The outcome of the study is supposed to help in understanding the complex dynamics of ions in plasma confinement and plasma processing of materials. Furthermore, the present work seeks to create a framework for two-fluid modeling of magnetized plasmas with any arbitrary magnetic field profiles. The analysis provided here is supposed to act as a basis for any future work in the respective field.'
